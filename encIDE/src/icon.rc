// note that the icon used by the Explorer (i.e. the programs icon) is the
// first icon in the executable and the icons are sorted both by their order

aaaaaaaa ICON "icon.ico"

// this icon is used with wxFrame::SetIcon()
sample ICON "icon.ico"

// is needed to enable visual styles on Windows XP - see docs/msw/winxp.txt

// this is not always needed but doesn't hurt (except making the executable
// very slightly larger): this file contains the standard icons, cursors, ...
